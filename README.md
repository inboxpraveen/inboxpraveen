## 🛠 Recent Projects:
1. **Context Vector Search Engine** - A simple interface where users can search for contextually relevant text passages in documents. It employs BERT model for semantic embeddings and FAISS for efficient similarity search. When users enter a query, the system returns the most contextually relevant text passage from the corpus and highlights the matched keywords.
