I'm Praveen Kumar, a Principal AI Engineer and Solution Architect based in Bengaluru. I design and build end-to-end AI products, like speech AI, OCR, and LLM-powered systems, that work reliably in the real world. I enjoy turning complex ideas into practical, production-ready solutions and sharing what I learn through open source and blogs. When I'm not coding, I mentor teams and focus on making AI infrastructure fast, modular, and aligned with business goals.
